## 📋 Problem Statement
Teachers and students often face significant challenges with preparing for exams:

### Challenges for Teachers:
- 🕒 **Time-Consuming**: Teachers spend valuable time manually preparing question papers, especially when tests are scheduled unexpectedly.
- 📑 **Lack of Automation**: Preparing custom question papers can be tedious, requiring careful selection of questions and topics.

### Challenges for Students:
- 🤔 **Struggling with Practice**: Students often have difficulty generating relevant practice questions from study materials (e.g., textbooks, notes).
- 🧠 **Inefficient Study**: Without comprehensive self-assessment tools, students may focus on less important content or miss critical topics.

## 💡 Solution Approach
My solution is a **mobile app** that combines **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to automatically generate question papers from scanned images or PDFs of study materials. 

### Key Features:
1. **📸 OCR for Text Extraction**: The app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned images or PDFs of study materials (like books, notes, etc.).
2. **🤖 Large Language Model (LLM)**: The extracted text is processed by an LLM to generate relevant and meaningful question papers based on the content.
3. **📚 Comprehensive Exam Preparation**: Automatically generated question papers allow students to practice based on actual study materials, ensuring a more thorough and focused review.
4. **⚡ Saves Time for Teachers**: Teachers can save time by automating question paper generation, enabling them to quickly prepare tests, quizzes, or practice papers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **OCR Technology**: Utilizes OCR libraries (e.g., Tesseract) to extract text from images and PDFs.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Powered by a language model (e.g., GPT) for text-based question generation and content understanding.
- **Mobile App Development**: Built for both **iOS** and **Android** using cross-platform tool **Flutter** .
- **Backend**: A robust backend powered by **Firebase** and **OpenAI API Key** to handle OCR processing, LLM interactions, and data storage.

## 🔄 How It Works
1. **📸 Upload Materials**: Teachers or students upload scanned images or PDFs of study materials (like textbooks, notes, etc.) into the app.
2. **🧠 Text Extraction with OCR**: The app uses OCR technology to extract the text from the uploaded materials.
3. **💬 Question Generation with LLM**: The extracted text is then processed by an LLM to generate relevant questions, such as:
   - Multiple choice questions (MCQs)
   - Short answer questions
   - Long-form essay questions
4. **📑 Question Paper Output**: The generated question paper is presented to the user, who can adjust settings like difficulty, question type, and more.
5. **📚 Practice Mode**: Students can use the generated question papers to practice, improving their exam preparation.
